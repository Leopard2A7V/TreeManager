# TreeManager
Tree manager website project is developed, built and modified by myself (Imperial Tu Ho).

This project is made for my graduation essay (2020-2021) about managing risk of falling tree in region 2 of CTU (Can Tho University).

Tree informations are collected from sensor Nodes programmed on STM32F103C8T6 (Senders) and Raspberry Pi 3+ for the gateway (Uploading).

Thanks to my team contributor (Ngo Nguyen Khanh Duy).
